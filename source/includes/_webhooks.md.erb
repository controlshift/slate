# Webhook Endpoints

Webhooks can be used by software engineers to integrate ControlShift with third-party systems. They allow engineers to build software that is triggered by events that take place within ControlShift. ControlShift would execute HTTP calls when certain event happen (e.g. a petition is launched; a category is changed).

To begin using these new webhooks, go to the admin homepage and click "Settings" under "Manage." Then choose the "CRM Integration & Webhooks" tab and click "Configure Webhook Endpoints." To begin sending data, you'll need to add a "New Webhook Endpoint." Each Webhook Endpoint URL receives a full firehose of all hooks that occur within ControlShift.

We recommend using a tool like [RequestBin](http://requestb.in/) to help debug and develop your webhook integration. RequestBin allows engineers to see all of the webhooks generated by the application and sent to an endpoint.

If you need additional information about webhooks or how to use them, please send us a support email [support@controlshiftlabs.com](mailto:support@controlshiftlabs.com). We'd also love stories about how customers are using webhooks.

### Retries

For webhook notifications successfully processed the response should have an HTTP 2XX status code. Responses returning a different status code will be marked as failed and automatically retried up to 9 times with an exponential backoff (e.g.: after 15s, 30s, 90s, etc.).

If after 9 retries the notification cannot be delivered, the webhook endpoint will be automatically disabled and will need to be re-enabled from the admin page to start receiving webhook notifications again.

## Webhook types summary

You can configure ControlShift Labs Webhooks to return the following event types:

Type | Description
---------- | -------
<% data.webhooks.each do |webhook| %>
[<%= webhook.webhook %>](#<%= webhook.webhook.gsub('.','-') %>) | <%= webhook.description %>
<% end %>


<% data.webhooks.each do |webhook| %>
## <%= webhook.webhook %>
> Example payload for `<%= webhook.webhook %>`:

<% if webhook.payload %>
  ```json
  <%= JSON.pretty_generate(webhook.payload) %>
  ```
<% end %>

<%= webhook.description %>

<% if webhook.notes %>
  <%= webhook.notes %>
<% end %>

<% end %>
